## Dataset

### NARMA 

In the paper, we describe four NARMA scenarios. 

You can find the raw data to train and test (out-of-distribution testing) the models in [data/narma/6](data/narma/6/).

```narma_2d_i_n0.csv``` contains the data for i<sup>th</sup> Scenario. 

```TimeSynthCombGen-spurious_corr.zip``` in [data/narma/6](data/narma/6/) contains the data generating scripts, which have been taken from TimeSynth [repository](https://github.com/TimeSynth/TimeSynth).

### Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)

Raw data corresponding to PMSM described in the paper is present in [data/pmsm/](data/pmsm/). 

```GEM_PMSM.ipynb``` is the data-generating notebook which is taken from GEM [repository](https://github.com/upb-lea/gym-electric-motor).
